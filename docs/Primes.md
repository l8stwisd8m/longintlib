# Primes, Primality tests & Factorization

## Overview

The `longintprime.h` header consists of definition of one basic type, prototypes of functions, and constants, providing various methods of factorization, primality tests, and other necessities for operating prime numbers. There are some definifions of long integer value sizes and arrays used for prime fields as well.

**Prerequisites**:  
• `lil_prng.c`  
• `lil_jacobi.c`  

The `primes.sh` script can be used to move all the necessary files, required by this module, to `src`, `include` and `test` directories, and recompile the library automatically. One can just run:
```
chmod +x primes.sh
./primes.sh
```
